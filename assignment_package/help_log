Milestone 1 Help Log 11/11/24

Sophia Szczepek - Procedural Terrain Milestone 1
I used lecture slides and example code from class to make the two height functions. I also used lecture slide from noise function lecture
and I used some of my noise function from HW5. Other than that I did not use any other help.

One An - Chunking
TA Aaron Tian helped me debugging using render doc. And TA Christine Kneer helped me with debugging the logic of createvbo.

Sofia Szczepek - Cave & post processing Milestone 2
Did not use any help besides lecture slides and old homework assignments

One An - Multi Threading
TA initially helped me create a structure where a new thread is created for each chunk, but Professor Mally
suggested a different way of having fixed number of threads constantly running.

Nico Kong - Textures
Classmate Cedric gave me advice on rendering water.

One An - milestone 3
Asked Professor Mally help on how to go about making a tornado. He suggested multiple different methods and even gave me
a obj file to render for it. He also helped me with the issue of the raindrop stretching when one vertex of the raindrop
was at the bottom and the other was on the top.

Sophia Szczepek - Milestone 3
Went to office hours and got help from Prof. Mally to implement the Inventory Rectangle class.
Used C++ and GLSL document references and used Google Images of Minecraft inventories for reference on the design.
